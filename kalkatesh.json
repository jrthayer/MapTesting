The problem, however, lies in that there are three taverns in the city—each vying for supremacy with their beverages. And each of them claim that they are the original tavern, which only adds to the confusion and to the rivalry. These taverns have become so well known that there is a yearly national festival dedicated to the drinks that they serve, and the population of the city during this time swells from the 3,000 regular residents to a staggering 20,000.\n\nThe taverns are Janicki's Jack, Crosseyed Mule, and Poppys Port in the Storm Pop. Each tavern serves their own unique and distinct alcohol and beverage.\n\nOne of the more well known—though not necessarily enough to claim without a shadow of a doubt that it is superior—is Uncle Poppy’s Elixir of Everything, served at Poppys Port in the Storm Pop. It is supposedly so potent and delectable that a single drink is enough to cause the drinker to become addicted to it. This is rumored to be because of the rare ingredients used to create the drink, and one of those is whispered to be the tears of an angel.\n\nOf course there has never been any definitive proof of this brought forth, and Poppy, the owner of the tavern would be the first to deny that rumor.

This made it nearly impossible for those trained otherwise to control the horses movements.\n\nDuring the later years, when the lizard folk were conquering lands, most of Steelfield was left in shambles, and almost non-existent. With no choice but to band together with other city-states, they were able to train a few others to use what little horses were left.\n\nWhen the lizard folk did not come back, there was a massive effort in funding Steelfield back to its former state. The government built a Calvary Academy, and for a while was funding the town constructed around it. It wasn’t long before they were able to breed their horses back to fruition."

However, Orde's mistrust of the darker things have led to many unfortunate events, including war and the rise of the Inquisition.\n\nThe Reckoning shattered the belief system of Orde to its very core. Not only did they have to use the power of evil to assist in defending the Seven against a great threat, but they lost many of their deities of the past in this time of trouble.\n\nModern day Orde attempts to follow the Seven's doctrine of hope, but old habits die hard and there is a stirring of mistrust and a quiet desperation because this peace can only be maintained for so long and the scales are imbalanced."

For within the clouds they would be unchallenged and unmolested —but what to do with all the population— for the great city could not fit them all.\n\nThe elders believed the fairest way was pure chance and so a series of random allotments were decided, these people would be those that would ascend to the heavens while the rest would stay below. Much to the surprise of those in power, not a single soul attempted to cheat, the allotments were made and the people that were once unified in knowledge would now be separated by distance.\n\nThe people of Khao are stronger knit than most so it was agreed by those in the sky that they would always care for those below; that as their fleet grew larger, they would land and gather the tribes. The eventual goal of the Khaons is to ascend all of their people and they have kept to that promise for these 500 years."

The only home he could find was among the plants, so he started to grow intune with the nature around him. When he saw the small field of brambles, he saw something greater that could lie within—a true home.\n\nHe spent years using druidic magic to grow the brambles into a large shelter. In time his family grew, and he needed to expand the brambles around him. The thorns that protected him kept growing and growing until it could house a small town. With a home finally made, he could step down as leader and let someone else lead.\n\nHe had to be sure that the leader of the tribe would be someone he could trust, and someone who could defend themselves in this savage home. He proposed solutions to this: Firstly, the leader must be of Titalla’s blood—a relative of some sort. And secondly, they must win in a trial by combat against the previous leader. With these rules in place, Thornscorn blossomed into the town it is now."
